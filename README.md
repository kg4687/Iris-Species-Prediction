# Iris-Species-Prediction

Here I have used Machine Learning using these two methods : 

    Logistic Regression 
    Descision Tree
    
    

The data has been taken from Kaggle site the link is : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris


It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:

    1) Id
    2) SepalLengthCm
    3) SepalWidthCm
    4) PetalLengthCm
    5) PetalWidthCm
    6) Species
